## Synopsis
In this report we aim to describe which type of US weather events are most harmful with respect to population health and which have the greatest economic consequences.

## Data Processing

### Reading in the data
We first read in the data from the csv file in [Storm Data](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2FStormData.csv.bz2) 47mb bz2 file, as specified in the assignment. 
```{r}
orig.storms <- read.csv("data/repdata-data-StormData.csv", stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
```

After reading in the data we see that there are 902297 observations and 37 variables in this dataset.
```{r}
dim(orig.storms)
```

We survey the first few rows in this dataset.  These documents help us find how some of the variables are constructed/defined.

  - National Climatic Data Center Storm Events [FAQ](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fpeer2_doc%2FNCDC%20Storm%20Events-FAQ%20Page.pdf)

```{r}
head(orig.storms)
```

To improve R code performance, we can reduce the dataset to only those variables we need.
```{r}
storms <- orig.storms[,c("EVTYPE", "FATALITIES")]
dim(storms)
```

There are 985 different event types `EVTYPE`.
```{r}
unique(orig.storms$EVTYPE)
```
